package migrate

// ConfigDrops lists, per resource type, the old settable attributes kmigrate
// removes from a customer's .tf because the new schema no longer accepts them.
// These are OBSOLETE fields with no new home — timestamps the provider now
// computes (last_updated), removed toggles (system_managed_policy), and settings
// the new schema dropped. Removing them is exactly what a customer would do by
// hand to make `terraform plan` parse; kmigrate reports each removal.
//
// Deliberately EXCLUDED (handled elsewhere, never auto-dropped here):
//   - Renamed attributes (e.g. account name → account_name): the rename pass
//     rewrites them; they are not obsolete.
//   - kion_azure_policy's body (name/description/policy/parameters): folded into
//     the nested azure_policy object — a documented manual config change, not a
//     drop (auto-dropping would silently discard the policy body).
//
// The *_account resources are NOT excluded. Their state migrates via Layer 3
// import, but their config is still rewritten here — kmigrate already renames
// name → account_name on all three — so an obsolete settable attribute left in
// place fails `terraform validate` just like anywhere else.
//
// TestConfigDropsAreSettableAndRemoved keeps this consistent with the schema
// snapshots: every entry must be an old settable attribute genuinely absent from
// the new schema. TestCompleteness_settableDropsAreDocumented is the wider
// ledger of every settable attribute the new schema dropped, reviewed or not.

// ReadOnlyDrops is ConfigDrops' sibling for the other way an old settable
// attribute stops being writable: the new schema still HAS it, but only as a
// computed (read-only) value the provider fills in. Terraform rejects those in
// config with "Invalid Configuration for Read-Only Attribute", so they have to
// come out of the .tf too — but ConfigDrops cannot hold them, because its guard
// asserts the attribute is absent from the new schema and these are present.
//
// The same rewrite pass applies both tables; the only difference is the guard.
//
// EXCLUDED: every resource's `id`. SDKv2 injects a top-level optional+computed
// `id` into every resource schema whether or not the provider declared one, so
// all 33 old resources report it as settable. It is an artifact of the SDK, not
// an attribute a practitioner writes, and the new provider declares it computed
// as it always was — dropping it would be noise on every single block.
//
// TestReadOnlyDropsArePresentAndComputed keeps this in step with the snapshots,
// both ways round: every entry must be settable in old and read-only in new, and
// every attribute the snapshots show becoming read-only must have an entry.

	// The old resource made the note's author a required input; the new one takes
	// it from the authenticated caller and reports it back.
