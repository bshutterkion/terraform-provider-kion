# Fail if anything internal has crept into the tree.
#
# This repository is public and accepts outside contributions. Internal
# references, such as backend source paths, internal hostnames, internal
# repo/group names, and AI planning notes, are not secrets, but they leak
# implementation detail nobody outside can act on, and once published they live
# in every fork. A reviewer cannot reliably catch them by eye, so this runs in
# CI.
#
# A denylist of internal names is itself an internal reference: committing the
# literal strings publishes the index of what we are trying not to publish, and
# this script has to exclude itself from its own grep to avoid matching. So the
# committed list holds only patterns that name nothing in particular, and the
# specific literals are supplied at runtime:
#
#   INTERNAL_REF_PATTERNS       newline-separated extended regexes
#   INTERNAL_REF_PATTERNS_FILE  path to a file of the same, one per line,
#                               '#' comments and blank lines ignored
#                               (default: scripts/.internal-refs-private,
#                                which .gitignore keeps untracked)
#
# In CI, set INTERNAL_REF_PATTERNS from a repository secret. Locally, keep the
# private file. With neither, the committed patterns still run and the script
# says the private set was not loaded, so a silently weakened check is visible
# rather than assumed.
#
# Adding a term is cheap. Removing one should be deliberate.

This repo is public. Remove the reference, or describe the behaviour without
citing internal sources: "the API returns X" rather than a backend file path.
If a term is now legitimately public, drop it from the pattern set in the same
change, so the reason is reviewable.
