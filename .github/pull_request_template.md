## Changelog Entry

<!--
Required for user-facing changes; not required for docs, tests, or refactors
with no behavior change.

This repo uses changie. Run `make changelog-new` and answer the prompts — it
writes a YAML file under `.changes/unreleased/`. Commit that file with your
change. Do not edit CHANGELOG.md by hand; it is generated at release time.

Kinds: BREAKING CHANGES, FEATURES, NEW RESOURCES, ENHANCEMENTS, BUG FIXES, NOTES
